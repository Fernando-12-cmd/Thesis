\section{Introduction}
In 2017 it was implemented the new Public Education System with the creation of "Local Services of Public Education" (Servicios Locales de Educación Pública in spanish). This will be a gradual process beginning in 2017 and ending in 2025 (Rowland, 2018).

\section{Public Education in Chile}
The decentralization process in Chile began in 1980s with a gradual process that ended in 1987. This system worked during 1990s and 2000s but it was changed in 2017 due to social protest in 2006, 2011 and mainly in 2019.


A couple of interesting papers I read recently are \cite{lopez_definicion_2018}
